They have been made just because they were on the original GS and for that; strange case when somebody too crazy have used them. Nevertheless, DO NOT USE THEM! They can disappear or even radically; change functionality in future firmware releases.DAMNPORT1	equ	#0A ; writing or reading this port sets data bit to the inverse of bit 0 into MPAG portDAMNPORT2	equ	#0B ; the same as DAMNPORT1, but instead command bit involved, which is made equal to 5th bit of VOL4LEDCTR		equ	#01 ; write-only, controls on-board LED. D0=0 - LED is on, D0=1 - LED is off			    ; reset state is LED on.GSCFG0	equ	#0F ; read-write, GS ConFiG port 0: acts as memory cell, reads previously written value.
